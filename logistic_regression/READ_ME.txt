1. linear regression

1.1 This script includes a script that runs randomized linear regression.
Based on supervised learning it attempts to find the perfect match for the formula
y=a*x+b. 
This supervised learning uses the derivative of the Mean Absolute Error to attempt
a perfect fit for the random data. With the acquired (a) and (b) values assumptions 
can be made for unknown x-values and its corresponding y-value.

2. Usage:
To use this script you can change the variables in the linear regression runner.
This holds the number of iterations for the random value, initial (a) and (b), 
and the range for random values
